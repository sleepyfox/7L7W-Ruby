Code Dojo 18
============
This is a worked example for the exercise that goes along with the London Code Dojo's day 3 of the Ruby section of the book 'Seven Languages in Seven Weeks' by Bruce Tate.

I have linked the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/sleepyfox/london-code-dojo-7l7w-ruby-day-3) from the meeting. You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
